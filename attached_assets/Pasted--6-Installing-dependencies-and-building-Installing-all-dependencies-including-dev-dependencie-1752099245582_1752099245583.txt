  Use the relative path "./vite" to reference the file "server/vite.ts". Without
  the leading "./", the path "vite" is being interpreted as a package path
  instead.

        ╵                              ~~~~~~

  You can mark the path "vite" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which
  will remove this error and leave the unresolved path in the bundle.

  You can mark the path "@vitejs/plugin-react" as external to exclude it from
  the bundle, which will remove this error and leave the unresolved path in the
  bundle.

  You can mark the path "@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal" as external to

  You can mark the path "@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer" as external to
  exclude it from the bundle, which will remove this error and leave the
  unresolved path in the bundle. You can also add ".catch()" here to handle this
  failure at run-time instead of bundle-time.
